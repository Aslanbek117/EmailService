## **Hello, Marcel.**

## I'm using SendGrid Email service provider to send a Emails. [https://sendgrid.com/](https://sendgrid.com/)

You need to create a free account to use this service provider and bind your email that will send a emails

After all, paste your email (test_email@gmail.com) and password (qwerty123) in application.conf file. 
Thats all.

You are great.
